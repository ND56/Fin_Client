## Overview

Fin is a conversational companion and personal assistant for users to interact with. Users are prompted to create a profile upon logging in, after which they are free to engage with Fin and edit or delete their profile as they see fit.

Interactions with Fin are processed through the use of web sockets and each client interaction is siloed from others, which is achieved through a combination of (1) having each client generate a unique dialogflow session and (2) having the Fin API socket only broadcast Fin's responses to the client that prompted the response.

## Functionality

In it's current iteration, users can prompt Fin to do the following:

1. Tell jokes
2. Muse on the meaning of life
3. Engage in simple conversation
4. Provide a random fact
5. Send text messages
6. Report on the weather
7. Search the web
